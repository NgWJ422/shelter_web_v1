#This is Amirul's branch. 
I will update what I had done in this README.md. (Insert emoji smile)
This is what I had done:
1. Combine my website and Jie and adjust it
2. Update the Contact Us section. Can press submit button and the data will go to dummy gmail that I just created. (Email:dummykido81@gmail.com)
3. Added a stylish looking footer and add social media in it.
4. I update the gallery to look like photogrid gallery. The only problem is its not really interactive for each picture.
